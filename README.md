# tgbf

A bitmap font format that no one asked for:
- Designed to be used primarily for indie game development.
- Can be used with *Ebitengine* through *tinne26/ptxt*.
- Some fonts with permissive licenses are available at *tinne26/fonts/tgbf/*.
- Font editor is available at *tgbf-editor*.

This is an opinionated format with many hard limits, a specific memory layout for the data and a fair amount of unconventional choices (when compared to more standard font formats). Compatibility with existing formats is a non-goal. Being "generally better" than existing formats is a non-goal. I do have some knowledge about text rendering and font formats, but I don't claim to be an authority nor having done extensive research. I simply built what I wanted to build based on my experience with *etxt* and game development with Ebitengine.
